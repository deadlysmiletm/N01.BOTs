First demo game made using Unity, and first approach to game development with Unity and C#, developed has a study project when I was studing.
Release: 2016.

The game had a big influence on the retro game "Elevator Action" with some extra mechanics. At this point is very amateur and had some bugs, but I'm very proud this was my first attempt facing Unity to make a game alone.

<b>Itch.io build download soon!</b>
