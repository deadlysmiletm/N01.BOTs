This is my first prototype game made using Unity and C#, which I created as a study project while I was learning game development. 

<b>NOTE: Only available has a portfolio game and isn't recommended to be played has a complete game.</b>


Developed: 2016.

The game had a big influence on the retro game "Elevator Action" with some extra mechanics. At this point is very amateur and had some bugs, but I'm very proud this was my first attempt facing Unity to make a game alone.
